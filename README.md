# HullCS50.github.io
Website for the Hull University School of Computer Science 50th Anniversary Event

The site is live at [https://hullcs50.com/](https://hullcs50.com/)

It is based on the [Themefisher Bingo template](https://github.com/themefisher/bingo-bootstrap). If you use this template for a site of your own you need to update the [Slick plugin](https://kenwheeler.github.io/slick/) to make it work correctly on Safari.
